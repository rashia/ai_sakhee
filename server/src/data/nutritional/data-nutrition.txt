COMMON NUTRITION MISTAKES:

❌ Skipping meals (worsens insulin resistance)
❌ Only eating "diet" foods (unsustainable)
❌ Cutting out all carbs (not necessary)
❌ Drinking fruit juices (even fresh, spikes sugar)
❌ Fat-free products (often high in sugar)
❌ Excessive "healthy" fats (still calories)
❌ Not eating enough protein
❌ Comparing with others (everyone is different)
❌ Expecting quick results (takes 3-6 months)
❌ Being too restrictive (leads to binge eating)

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

MONTH 1-2:
- Better energy levels
- Reduced cravings
- Improved digestion
- Better mood

MONTH 3-4:
- Weight loss starts (if overweight)
- Some improvement in skin
- Better sleep

MONTH 5-6:
- Menstrual cycle may regulate
- Noticeable weight loss
- Improved skin and hair
- Better lab values

LONG-TERM (6-12 months):
- Sustained weight management
- Regular cycles
- Reduced hirsutism
- Improved fertility markers
- Better overall health

REMEMBER:
- Nutrition is most powerful tool for PCOS
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Small sustainable changes better than drastic diets
- Focus on adding good foods, not just removing bad ones
- Your body needs time to heal
- Every woman's body responds differently
