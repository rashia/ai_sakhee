--- DEPRESSION / LOW MOOD ---
SYMPTOM: Persistent sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, fatigue, crying spells
UNDERLYING CAUSE: Hormonal imbalance, inflammation, neurotransmitter deficiency, chronic stress
NUTRITIONAL STRATEGY: Anti-inflammatory diet, foods supporting serotonin/dopamine, omega-3, B-vitamins
KEY NUTRIENTS: Omega-3, magnesium, B-vitamins (especially folate, B12), vitamin D, iron, zinc, tryptophan

FOODS TO EMPHASIZE:
  All Regions:
    - Same as anxiety section above
    - Emphasize: Fatty fish (if non-veg), eggs, leafy greens, nuts, seeds
    - Dark chocolate (85%+ cacao, small amount) - mood-boosting

FOODS TO AVOID/LIMIT:
- Alcohol (depressant)
- Excessive sugar (inflammation, crashes)
- Processed foods (nutrient-poor)
- Inflammatory foods (refined carbs, trans fats)

MEAL TIMING:
- Don't skip meals (blood sugar crashes worsen mood)
- Include protein at all meals (amino acids for neurotransmitters)
- Omega-3 daily (critical for brain health)

SUPPLEMENTS TO CONSIDER (CONSULT DOCTOR):
- Omega-3 fish oil (2g EPA/DHA shown effective in studies)
- Vitamin D (if deficient - strongly linked to depression)
- Methylated folate + B12 (if MTHFR variant or deficient)
- SAMe (S-adenosyl methionine - proven antidepressant effect)
- St. John's Wort (caution - interacts with many medications)

LIFESTYLE INTEGRATION:
- **Seek professional help** - depression requires medical evaluation
- Therapy (CBT, IPT proven effective)
- Exercise (30 min/day as effective as antidepressants in some studies)
- Light exposure (morning sunlight supports circadian rhythm)
- Social connection (isolation worsens depression)
- Sleep (depression and insomnia bidirectional)

--- BRAIN FOG / POOR CONCENTRATION ---
SYMPTOM: Mental fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, "fuzzy thinking"
UNDERLYING CAUSE: Blood sugar instability, insulin resistance, inflammation, poor sleep, nutrient deficiency
NUTRITIONAL STRATEGY: Stable blood sugar, anti-inflammatory, brain-boosting nutrients
KEY NUTRIENTS: Omega-3 (DHA), B-vitamins, iron, magnesium, antioxidants

FOODS TO EMPHASIZE:
  North India:
    - Brain fats: Walnuts, ghee (1 tsp), flaxseeds, almonds
    - Antioxidants: Berries (limited), turmeric, green tea
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, whole grains, legumes
  
  South India:
    - Brain fats: Fish (salmon, mackerel), coconut, sesame
    - Antioxidants: Curry leaves, turmeric, green tea
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, ragi, brown rice
  
  East India:
    - Brain fats: Fatty fish, mustard oil, flaxseeds
    - Antioxidants: Green tea, turmeric
    - B-vitamins: Fish, eggs, leafy greens
  
  West India:
    - Brain fats: Coconut, groundnuts, flaxseeds
    - Antioxidants: Kokum, turmeric, green tea
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, jowar, bajra

FOODS TO AVOID/LIMIT:
- High-GI foods (cause blood sugar swings → brain fog)
- Excessive caffeine (initially helps, then crashes)
- Alcohol (impairs cognition)

MEAL TIMING:
- Never skip breakfast (brain needs fuel)
- Protein + healthy fat at every meal
- Avoid blood sugar rollercoaster

SUPPLEMENTS TO CONSIDER (CONSULT DOCTOR):
- Omega-3 (DHA specifically for brain)
- B-complex (energy and cognition)
- Iron (if deficient - check ferritin)
- Magnesium (helps with focus)

LIFESTYLE INTEGRATION:
- Sleep (7-9 hours non-negotiable for cognitive function)
- Exercise (increases BDNF - brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
- Stress management (cortisol impairs memory)
- Cognitive exercises (reading, puzzles)
- Limit multitasking


### SYMPTOM CATEGORY 6: ENERGY & FATIGUE ###

--- CHRONIC FATIGUE ---
SYMPTOM: Persistent exhaustion, low energy, difficulty completing daily tasks, need for naps
UNDERLYING CAUSE: Insulin resistance, anemia, thyroid dysfunction, poor sleep, nutrient deficiencies, inflammation
NUTRITIONAL STRATEGY: Balanced meals for steady energy, adequate protein, iron if deficient, B-vitamins, complex carbs
KEY NUTRIENTS: Iron, B-vitamins (especially B12), magnesium, CoQ10, vitamin D, protein

FOODS TO EMPHASIZE:
  North India:
    - Iron-rich: Dates, spinach, amaranth, chickpeas, pomegranate, eggs
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, whole grains, dal, chicken
    - Energy foods: Complex carbs (whole wheat, millets) in moderate amounts, protein at each meal
  
  South India:
    - Iron-rich: Ragi, drumstick leaves, dates, sesame, curry leaves, fish
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, ragi, brown rice, fish
    - Energy foods: Idli with more dal, sambar, brown rice (small portions)
  
  East India:
    - Iron-rich: Leafy greens (saag), dates, fish, beetroot
    - B-vitamins: Fish, eggs, whole grains
    - Energy foods: Red rice (small), dal, fish
  
  West India:
    - Iron-rich: Dates, leafy vegetables, groundnuts, sesame
    - B-vitamins: Eggs, jowar, bajra
    - Energy foods: Jowar/bajra rotis, dal, sprouted beans

FOODS TO AVOID/LIMIT:
- Simple sugars (give temporary energy then crash)
- Excessive caffeine (masks fatigue, doesn't fix it)
- Large heavy meals (cause post-meal fatigue)

MEAL TIMING:
- Eat within 1 hour of waking (kickstarts metabolism)
- Small frequent meals (prevents energy dips)
- Protein at every meal (sustained energy)
- Don't skip meals

SUPPLEMENTS TO CONSIDER (CONSULT DOCTOR):
- Iron (if ferritin <30, optimal for energy is 50-70)
- Vitamin B12 (if deficient - common in vegetarians)
- Vitamin D (if deficient)
- CoQ10 (cellular energy production)
- Check thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4)

LIFESTYLE INTEGRATION:
- Sleep quality (not just quantity - 7-9 hours quality sleep)
- Exercise (counterintuitive but increases energy over time)
- Stress management (chronic stress causes fatigue)
- Screen time before bed (disrupts sleep quality)
- Rule out: Anemia, thyroid, vitamin D, B12, sleep apnea
