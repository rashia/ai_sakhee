INSULIN RESISTANCE AND PCOS - Complete Guide for Indian Women

WHAT IS INSULIN RESISTANCE?
Insulin resistance occurs when cells in muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and cannot easily absorb glucose from blood. The pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter cells. This excess insulin worsens PCOS symptoms.

WHY IT MATTERS IN PCOS:
- 70-80% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance
- Insulin resistance drives androgen production (male hormones)
- Creates a vicious cycle: High insulin → More androgens → Worse PCOS symptoms
- Leads to weight gain, especially around abdomen
- Increases diabetes risk significantly

SIGNS YOU MAY HAVE INSULIN RESISTANCE:
- Dark patches of skin (acanthosis nigricans) on neck, armpits, groin
- Skin tags
- Intense sugar cravings, especially after meals
- Feeling tired after eating
- Difficulty losing weight despite diet and exercise
- Apple-shaped body (weight around middle)
- Brain fog or difficulty concentrating
- Increased hunger shortly after eating
- Frequent urination and thirst

TESTS TO DIAGNOSE INSULIN RESISTANCE:
1. Fasting Insulin: Optimal <7 µIU/mL, concerning >10 µIU/mL
2. Fasting Glucose: Normal <100 mg/dL, prediabetes 100-125 mg/dL
3. HbA1c: Normal <5.7%, prediabetes 5.7-6.4%, diabetes ≥6.5%
4. HOMA-IR: Calculated from fasting glucose and insulin (>2.5 suggests IR)
5. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): 2-hour glucose and insulin levels
6. Lipid Profile: High triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol

INDIAN POPULATION SPECIFIC:
- Indians develop insulin resistance at lower BMI (>23 kg/m²)
- Higher visceral (belly) fat even at normal weight
- Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance
- Earlier onset of type 2 diabetes (younger age)
- Higher carbohydrate diet traditionally increases risk

DIETARY MANAGEMENT FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:

FOODS TO EMPHASIZE:
- Low Glycemic Index (GI) foods
- High fiber vegetables (50% of each meal)
- Lean proteins (dal, paneer, chicken, fish, eggs)
- Healthy fats (nuts, seeds, ghee in moderation, olive oil)
- Whole grains (limited portions) - brown rice, millets, quinoa
- Legumes and lentils (rich in fiber and protein)
- Leafy greens (palak, methi, amaranth)

FOODS TO LIMIT OR AVOID:
- White rice, refined wheat products (maida)
- Sugary foods and beverages
- Fruit juices (eat whole fruits instead)
- Processed snacks (biscuits, namkeen, chips)
- Deep fried foods (pakoras, samosas)
- High glycemic fruits in excess (mango, banana, grapes)
- Excessive sweet treats (mithai, desserts)

MEAL TIMING STRATEGIES:
- Eat within 12-hour window (e.g., 8 AM to 8 PM)
- Don't skip breakfast - stabilizes blood sugar
- Have protein with every meal
- Space meals 3-4 hours apart
- Avoid late night eating (after 8-9 PM)
- Smaller, frequent meals may help some women
- Consider intermittent fasting (16:8) if suitable and supervised

PORTION CONTROL (Indian Measurements):
- Vegetables: 2-3 katori (unlimited non-starchy)
- Protein: 1 katori or palm-sized portion
- Whole grain: 1-2 small katori or 1-2 rotis
- Healthy fats: 1-2 tablespoons per meal
- Fruits: 1 small fruit or 1 katori at a time

INDIAN MEAL SWAPS FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:
INSTEAD OF → CHOOSE
White rice → Brown rice, cauliflower rice, quinoa, jowar
Maida roti → Whole wheat, ragi, bajra roti
Regular aloo → Limited aloo with skin, more seasonal vegetables
Fruit juice → Whole fruit with skin (apple, pear, guava)
Sugary chai → Unsweetened green tea, herbal tea
Biscuits → Roasted chana, nuts, seeds
Pakoras → Grilled paneer, roasted vegetables
Sweet lassi → Buttermilk (chaas) without sugar
White bread → Multigrain bread (limited)
Poha/upma → Add vegetables, protein (eggs, nuts)

SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAY HELP (consult doctor first):
1. Myo-Inositol: 2000-4000mg daily
   - Improves insulin sensitivity
   - 80% of women see improvement
   - Best taken with meals

2. Berberine: 500mg 2-3 times daily
   - Similar to metformin in studies
   - Lowers blood sugar and insulin

3. Alpha-Lipoic Acid: 300-600mg daily
   - Antioxidant, improves insulin sensitivity

4. Chromium: 200-400mcg daily
   - Helps insulin work better

5. Magnesium: 300-400mg daily
   - Many PCOS women are deficient
   - Improves insulin sensitivity

6. Vitamin D: Supplement if deficient
   - Check levels, optimize to 40-60 ng/mL

7. Omega-3 fatty acids: 1000-2000mg daily
   - Reduces inflammation
   - Improves insulin sensitivity

EXERCISE FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:
- Most effective tool after diet
- Aim for 150 minutes per week minimum

TYPES OF EXERCISE:
1. Resistance/Strength Training (3-4x/week)
   - Builds muscle which uses glucose
   - Bodyweight exercises, weights, resistance bands
   - 30-45 minutes per session

2. Cardio (4-5x/week)
   - Walking, jogging, cycling, swimming
   - 30-60 minutes moderate intensity
   - Post-meal walks especially beneficial

3. HIIT (2-3x/week)
   - High Intensity Interval Training
   - 20-30 minutes
   - Very effective for insulin sensitivity

4. Yoga (daily if possible)
   - Reduces cortisol (stress hormone)
   - Improves insulin sensitivity
   - Helps with emotional wellbeing

LIFESTYLE FACTORS:
1. Sleep (7-8 hours)
   - Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance
   - Keep consistent sleep schedule
   - Dark, cool room

2. Stress Management
   - High cortisol worsens insulin resistance
   - Practice meditation, deep breathing
   - Adequate rest and self-care

3. Avoid sitting long periods
   - Get up every 30-60 minutes
   - Take short walking breaks
   - Use standing desk if possible

MEDICATIONS FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:
(Prescribed by doctor only)

1. Metformin
   - First-line medication
   - Typical dose: 500-2000mg daily
   - Take with meals to reduce side effects
   - Improves insulin sensitivity and ovulation
   - May cause B12 deficiency (supplement needed)

2. Inositol
   - Natural supplement, very safe
   - Myo-inositol + D-chiro-inositol combination
   - Improves egg quality and ovulation

MONITORING PROGRESS:
Track these monthly:
- Fasting glucose and insulin
- Weight and waist circumference
- Menstrual cycle regularity
- Energy levels
- Sugar cravings intensity
- Mood and sleep quality

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:
- Improvements visible in 3-6 months with consistent effort
- 5-10% weight loss significantly improves insulin sensitivity
- Diet and exercise more effective than medication alone
- Lifelong management needed, but gets easier with habit
- Small consistent changes better than drastic temporary changes

SUCCESS MARKERS:
✓ Stable energy throughout day
✓ Reduced sugar cravings
✓ Better mood and focus
✓ Regular menstrual cycles
✓ Gradual weight loss
✓ Improved lab values
✓ Reduced acne and hirsutism over time
✓ Better sleep quality

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
❌ Skipping meals (worsens insulin spikes)
❌ Only doing cardio (add strength training)
❌ Extreme low-calorie diets (slows metabolism)
❌ Cutting out all carbs (not sustainable)
❌ Relying only on medication without lifestyle changes
❌ Giving up too soon (needs 3-6 months to see results)
❌ Comparing progress with others (everyone is different)

REMEMBER:
- Insulin resistance is reversible with sustained effort
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Small daily choices compound over time
- You're not alone - millions of women manage this successfully
- Progress is not always linear - be patient with yourself

WHEN TO SEE DOCTOR:
- Fasting glucose >125 mg/dL on two occasions
- HbA1c ≥6.5%
- Severe symptoms despite lifestyle changes
- Planning pregnancy (optimize before conception)
- New symptoms or worsening condition
- Side effects from medications
