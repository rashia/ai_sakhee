PCOS/PCOD Medical Guidelines for Indian Women

WHAT IS PCOS?
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder affecting 8-10% of women of reproductive age in India. It involves irregular menstrual cycles, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries.

COMMON SYMPTOMS:
- Irregular or absent periods (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea)
- Excess facial and body hair (hirsutism)
- Acne and oily skin
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
- Thinning hair on scalp
- Darkening of skin (acanthosis nigricans) in neck, groin, under breasts
- Skin tags
- Mood changes, anxiety, depression
- Fatigue
- Sleep problems
- Fertility challenges

PCOS TYPES:
1. Insulin-Resistant PCOS (70% of cases in India)
   - High insulin levels
   - Weight gain around abdomen
   - Sugar cravings
   - Fatigue after meals

2. Inflammatory PCOS
   - Chronic inflammation markers elevated
   - Headaches, joint pain
   - Skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis)
   - Digestive issues

3. Post-Pill PCOS
   - Develops after stopping birth control pills
   - Temporary in many cases
   - Body rebalancing hormones

4. Adrenal PCOS
   - High DHEA-S levels
   - Stress-induced
   - Elevated cortisol
   - Less common type

DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA (Rotterdam Criteria - need 2 of 3):
1. Irregular ovulation or anovulation
2. Clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (12+ follicles per ovary)

COMMON TESTS:
- Hormone panel: LH, FSH, testosterone, DHEA-S, prolactin
- Metabolic panel: Fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile
- Thyroid function: TSH, T3, T4
- Ultrasound: Transvaginal or abdominal pelvic scan
- Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) - often elevated in PCOS

HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PCOS:
- Type 2 diabetes (50% risk by age 40)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
- Sleep apnea
- Endometrial cancer (due to unopposed estrogen)
- Gestational diabetes during pregnancy
- Depression and anxiety disorders

MANAGEMENT APPROACH:
PCOS cannot be "cured" but can be effectively managed through:

1. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS (First-line treatment)
   - Weight loss of 5-10% can restore ovulation
   - Regular exercise (150 minutes per week)
   - Stress management
   - Adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
   - Anti-inflammatory diet

2. DIETARY CHANGES
   - Low glycemic index foods
   - High fiber intake
   - Adequate protein (1.2-1.6g per kg body weight)
   - Healthy fats (omega-3)
   - Limit processed foods and sugar
   - Regular meal timing

3. MEDICATIONS (when prescribed by doctor)
   - Metformin (for insulin resistance)
   - Oral contraceptives (to regulate periods)
   - Anti-androgens (for hirsutism, acne)
   - Clomiphene or letrozole (for fertility)
   - Inositol supplements (especially myo-inositol)

4. FERTILITY TREATMENT (if needed)
   - Ovulation induction medications
   - IVF/IUI procedures
   - Lifestyle optimization before conception

WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY:
- Severe pelvic pain
- Heavy bleeding (soaking pad every 1-2 hours)
- Sudden severe headaches
- Vision changes
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe depression or suicidal thoughts
- Inability to conceive after 6-12 months of trying

REGULAR MONITORING NEEDED:
- Glucose/HbA1c: Every 6-12 months
- Lipid profile: Annually
- Blood pressure: Every 3-6 months
- Weight and BMI: Monthly
- Liver function: Annually if on medications
- Mental health screening: As needed

INDIAN CONTEXT SPECIFIC NOTES:
- Higher prevalence of insulin resistance in Indian women
- Genetic predisposition stronger in South Asian populations
- Lower BMI cutoffs for metabolic risk (>23 kg/m²)
- Family history important (mother, sisters often affected)
- Cultural factors around body image and fertility add emotional burden
- Traditional Indian diets can be adapted (whole grains, lentils, vegetables)

POSITIVE OUTCOMES WITH MANAGEMENT:
- 80% of women see improvement with lifestyle changes
- Regular periods can be restored in majority of cases
- Fertility rates improve significantly with treatment
- Metabolic health can be maintained lifelong
- Quality of life improves substantially

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- PCOS is a lifelong condition requiring ongoing management
- Each woman's PCOS is unique - personalized approach needed
- Regular medical follow-up is essential
- Mental health is as important as physical health
- Support groups and communities can be very helpful
- Early intervention prevents long-term complications
