EVIDENCE NOTES (brief; for app linking)
- South Asian PCOS: earlier onset, higher IR even at normal BMI; lifestyle/low‑GI improves insulin and cycles.
- Omega‑3 (fish or ALA seeds) improves lipids; possible androgen benefit.
- Vitamin D deficiency common in PCOS; repletion improves metabolic/ovulatory markers in deficient women.
- 5–10% weight loss often restores ovulation and improves metabolic profile.

DISCLAIMER: Educational use only; not medical advice. Interpret labs with a clinician.
