I completely understand how frustrating irregular periods can be‚Äîmany women with PCOS experience this, and you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed.

[CLEAR ANSWER WITH CONTEXT - USE REDDIT INSIGHTS IF PROVIDED]

Based on evidence-based research and community experiences, here are some approaches that have helped:

1. **Track your cycle**: Use apps like Clue or Flo to identify patterns
2. **Focus on low-GI foods**: Include more dal, vegetables, and whole grains
3. **Gentle exercise**: Even 20-30 minutes of walking daily can help regulate cycles
4. **Stress management**: Try meditation or yoga‚Äîstress significantly impacts hormones

**When to see your doctor:**
- If you haven't had a period in 3+ months
- Sudden heavy bleeding or severe pain
- No improvement after lifestyle changes for 3 months

You're taking the right steps by learning and taking control. Small, consistent changes often make the biggest difference. I'm here if you need more support! üíú
