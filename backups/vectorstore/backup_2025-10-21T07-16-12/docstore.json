resistance occurs when cells in muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and cannot easily absorb glucose from blood. The pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter cells. This excess insulin worsens PCOS symptoms.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS IN PCOS:\n- 70-80% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance\n- Insulin resistance drives androgen production (male hormones)\n- Creates a vicious cycle: High insulin → More androgens → Worse PCOS symptoms\n- Leads to weight gain, especially around abdomen\n- Increases diabetes risk significantly\n\nSIGNS YOU MAY HAVE INSULIN RESISTANCE:\n- Dark patches of skin (acanthosis nigricans) on neck, armpits, groin\n- Skin tags\n- Intense sugar cravings, especially after meals\n- Feeling tired after eating\n- Difficulty losing weight despite diet and exercise\n- Apple-shaped body (weight around middle)\n- Brain fog or difficulty concentrating\n- Increased hunger shortly after eating\n- Frequent urination and thirst\n\nTESTS TO DIAGNOSE INSULIN RESISTANCE:\n1. Fasting Insulin: Optimal <7 µIU/mL, concerning >10 µIU/mL\n2. Fasting Glucose: Normal <100 mg/dL, prediabetes 100-125 mg/dL\n3. HbA1c: Normal <5.7%, prediabetes 5.7-6.4%, diabetes ≥6.5%\n4. HOMA-IR: Calculated from fasting glucose and insulin (>2.5 suggests IR)\n5. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): 2-hour glucose and insulin levels\n6. Lipid Profile: High triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol\n\nINDIAN POPULATION SPECIFIC:\n- Indians develop insulin resistance at lower BMI (>23 kg/m²)\n- Higher visceral (belly) fat even at normal weight\n- Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance\n- Earlier onset of type 2 diabetes (younger age)\n- Higher carbohydrate diet traditionally increases risk\n\nDIETARY MANAGEMENT FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:\n\nFOODS TO EMPHASIZE:\n- Low Glycemic Index (GI) foods\n- High fiber vegetables (50% of each meal)\n- Lean proteins (dal, paneer, chicken, fish, eggs)\n- Healthy fats (nuts, seeds, ghee in moderation, olive oil)\n- Whole grains (limited portions) - brown rice, millets, quinoa\n- Legumes and lentils (rich in fiber and protein)\n- Leafy greens (palak, methi, amaranth)\n\nFOODS TO LIMIT OR AVOID:\n- White rice, refined wheat products (maida)\n- Sugary foods and beverages\n- Fruit juices (eat whole fruits instead)\n- Processed snacks (biscuits, namkeen, chips)\n- Deep fried foods (pakoras, samosas)\n- High glycemic fruits in excess (mango, banana, grapes)\n- Excessive sweet treats (mithai, desserts)\n\nMEAL TIMING STRATEGIES:\n- Eat within 12-hour window (e.g., 8 AM to 8 PM)\n- Don't skip breakfast - stabilizes blood sugar\n- Have protein with every meal\n- Space meals 3-4 hours apart\n- Avoid late night eating (after 8-9 PM)\n- Smaller, frequent meals may help some women\n- Consider intermittent fasting (16:8) if suitable and supervised\n\nPORTION CONTROL (Indian Measurements):\n- Vegetables: 2-3 katori (unlimited non-starchy)\n- Protein: 1 katori or palm-sized portion\n- Whole grain: 1-2 small katori or 1-2 rotis\n- Healthy fats: 1-2 tablespoons per meal\n- Fruits: 1 small fruit or 1 katori at a time\n\nINDIAN MEAL SWAPS FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:\nINSTEAD OF → CHOOSE\nWhite rice → Brown rice, cauliflower rice, quinoa, jowar\nMaida roti → Whole wheat, ragi, bajra roti\nRegular aloo → Limited aloo with skin, more seasonal vegetables\nFruit juice → Whole fruit with skin (apple, pear, guava)\nSugary chai → Unsweetened green tea, herbal tea\nBiscuits → Roasted chana, nuts, seeds\nPakoras → Grilled paneer, roasted vegetables\nSweet lassi → Buttermilk (chaas) without sugar\nWhite bread → Multigrain bread (limited)\nPoha/upma → Add vegetables, protein (eggs, nuts)\n\nSUPPLEMENTS THAT MAY HELP (consult doctor first):\n1. Myo-Inositol: 2000-4000mg daily\n   - Improves insulin sensitivity\n   - 80% of women see improvement\n   - Best taken with meals\n\n2. Berberine: 500mg 2-3 times daily\n   - Similar to metformin in studies\n   - Lowers blood sugar and insulin\n\n3. Alpha-Lipoic Acid: 300-600mg daily\n   - Antioxidant, improves insulin sensitivity\n\n4. Chromium: 200-400mcg daily\n   - Helps insulin work better\n\n5. Magnesium: 300-400mg daily\n   - Many PCOS women are deficient\n   - Improves insulin sensitivity\n\n6. Vitamin D: Supplement if deficient\n   - Check levels, optimize to 40-60 ng/mL\n\n7. Omega-3 fatty acids: 1000-2000mg daily\n   - Reduces inflammation\n   - Improves insulin sensitivity\n\nEXERCISE FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:\n- Most effective tool after diet\n- Aim for 150 minutes per week minimum\n\nTYPES OF EXERCISE:\n1. Resistance/Strength Training (3-4x/week)\n   - Builds muscle which uses glucose\n   - Bodyweight exercises, weights, resistance bands\n   - 30-45 minutes per session\n\n2. Cardio (4-5x/week)\n   - Walking, jogging, cycling, swimming\n   - 30-60 minutes moderate intensity\n   - Post-meal walks especially beneficial\n\n3. HIIT (2-3x/week)\n   - High Intensity Interval Training\n   - 20-30 minutes\n   - Very effective for insulin sensitivity\n\n4. Yoga (daily if possible)\n   - Reduces cortisol (stress hormone)\n   - Improves insulin sensitivity\n   - Helps with emotional wellbeing\n\nLIFESTYLE FACTORS:\n1. Sleep (7-8 hours)\n   - Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance\n   - Keep consistent sleep schedule\n   - Dark, cool room\n\n2. Stress Management\n   - High cortisol worsens insulin resistance\n   - Practice meditation, deep breathing\n   - Adequate rest and self-care\n\n3. Avoid sitting long periods\n   - Get up every 30-60 minutes\n   - Take short walking breaks\n   - Use standing desk if possible\n\nMEDICATIONS FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE:\n(Prescribed by doctor only)\n\n1.
